# Sine Model Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting a sine function using a neural network. The experiments focus on understanding the effect of neural network depth and width on model performance, especially when the total number of trainable parameters is kept constant.

## Google Colab Notebooks
- [Sine Function Model Analysis](sine_model_analysis.ipynb): This notebook contains the code for generating data, building and training the model, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Overview
The first part of the analysis explores how the neural network's performance changes as a function of depth and width, while keeping the total number of trainable parameters roughly constant.

The second part of the analysis demonstrates how the model's predictions evolve during training using a GIF that visualizes the model's predictions over time.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
